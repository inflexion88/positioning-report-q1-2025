# Gravitational Authority Model

A comprehensive positioning framework that explains why some companies effortlessly attract customers, partners, and market attention while others struggle to gain traction despite quality offerings.

## Overview

The Gravitational Authority Model represents a fundamental shift in how we understand positioning. Rather than seeing positioning as simply occupying a space in consumers' minds, this model conceptualizes positioning as a gravitational field that attracts and retains customers, partners, and market attention through consistent force applied over time.
